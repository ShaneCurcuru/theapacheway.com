Project Management Committees are responsible for running the technical direction of their projects within the official Apache project rules as mandated by the board. PMCs otherwise operate independently, and report directly to the board (and not to the President). The concept is that the individuals who have shown appropriate merit (contributor -> committer -> PMC member) deserve to set technical direction. PMC chairs are also Vice Presidents of the ASF, and thus are officially corporate officers.
