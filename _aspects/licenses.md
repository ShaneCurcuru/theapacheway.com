Apache projects make releases using the Apache License, currently 2.0. In very specific cases, certain pre-approved licences (known as Cat-A or Cat-B) may be used for binary-only, optional dependencies.

Using the Apache license for all projects ensures that users know what to expect.  The Apache license is designed to be permissive and provide our users maximum freedom to use our software as they wish.
