Community is more important to an Apache project than code; a healthy community is a strict requirement for new or contiuing projects. However the best way to attract a healthy community is to have some useful and interesting code. Note that not all Apache projects create code as their primary objective; witness the Community Development Committee, tasked with helping newcomers find their way around Apache.

Obviously, almost all Apache projects produce software code, and this is the fundamental mission of the ASF: providing software code for the public good.  Most Apache projects also provide "convenience binaries", or precompiled software products ready for use.
