Everyone at the ASF is presumed to be acting as an individual when participating in our projects. Membership, Committership, and PMC membership are granted to individuals, never companies or organizations.

Note that both corporations and individuals alike are welcome to join the formal Sponsorship program, where leadership gifts of undirected funds are formally acknowledged by the ASF. Sponsorships do not imply or allow any specific direction or leadership within the ASF.
