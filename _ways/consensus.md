Communities working in The Apache Way strive to get consensus on major decisions. Having the community work together is one of the most important parts of the Way, as well as one of the most difficult to implement.

Consensus does not mean 100% agreement; however it does mean that all individuals with merit will accept the current progress on the project until some better proposal is put forth.

In some ways, consensus is the counterpoint to merit.  Those with merit - who have become committers - get a vote on the project direction.  That does not mean they get to unilaterally set direction - just that they have a binding voice in the process forward.
