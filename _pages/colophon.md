The concepts of the Apache Way come from the 100's of ASF Members and thousands of Apache committers who have been building great community-run software at the ASF for over 18 years.  This description of the Apache Way is merely Shane's interpretation of the wisdom of all the Apache committers out there.  You can [read more about how the ASF works](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html) and see the [full list of ASF Members](https://www.apache.org/foundation/members) who have built the Way.
