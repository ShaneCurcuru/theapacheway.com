A key motto at Apache is: "If it didn't happen on the mailing list, it didn't happen."

## What this means in practice

All decisions about an Apache project's plans, activities, events, or changes 
must be done by the community on one of Apache's archived mailing lists.
Discussions and plan proposals often happen at events, in chats (Slack, 
IRC, IM, etc.) or other synchronous places.  But all final **decisions** 
about executing on the plan, checking in the new code, or launching the 
website must be made by the community asynchronously on the mailing list.

## What does "on the mailing list" mean?

It means you send the [PROPOSAL] or new idea or whatever to the appropriate 
dev@yourproject.apache.org mailing list, and then allow time for other 
community members to comment on the plan, or to simply give their assent 
with a +1.  Depending on the decision, it might be the user@ list or 
the private@ list, but it must be an ASF hosted and archived list.

## Why this is important

This is a policy requirement for Apache projects that the board enforces, 
but it's a good idea for any volunteer led projects, for several reasons:

- Mailing lists are asynchronous.  This allows community members from 
different locations and timezones to participate in making the final 
decision.  They may have additions or change requests to the proposal that 
should be reviewed when they come in.

- Mailing lists are archived.  This allows future newcomers to the 
project community to review past decisions and see both what was proposed, 
as well as how the community in the past made the final decision they did.
It also allows newcomers to understand any social expectations that 
a project community may have, like specific subject [TAGS] or RTC/CTR.

- Archived lists allow oversight.  A project's PMC is responsible for 
ensuring the direction of the project is decided independently and for 
the benefit of the whole contributor community.  Similarly, the ASF 
board and membership can then review a project's behaviors to ensure 
that they are acting appropriately as an Apache project.  In particular, 
this oversight often happens over time, and if a potential issue is 
reported in a project today, having access to the full archives of 
the project's past behavior is important.

- Email is ubiquitous.  While many individuals prefer one collaboration 
tool or another, email is truly universal and allows everyone with 
internet access to participate in the same manner, meaning all newcomers 
have a level playing field for reading and sharing ideas.

## apache.org references

This phrase is used on the official apache.org website in many places, 
although it's not necessarily described in detail in any single place:

- [Apache CouchDB Bylaws](https://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions) describing how this is an important part of their project's decision making process

This motto has been covered in a number of overview sessions at ApacheCon
over the year; so it appears in numerous slides, although the real 
explanation only comes out in the live talks (or videos).
